## Task ID 18 — Canonical Institutional Principles + Contradiction Remediation

**Date:** see git history (`aa85631`).
**Role:** Chief Enterprise Architect · Chief Constitutional Engineer · Chief
Systems Architect · Institutional Governance Auditor · Documentation
Architect.
**Scope:** Codify the six canonical institutional principles; create the
organizational roadmap; remediate every contradiction that presented planned
entities (Foundation, Holding Company, Operations Ltd., Markets Ltd.) as
currently existing.

### Context

The audit identified that several code files, components, and documents
presented future commercial entities (Foundation, Holding Company,
Operations Ltd., Markets Ltd.) as if they already exist. The platform is
currently operated by **JOZOUR LLC (New Jersey)**. A canonical source of
truth was missing.

### Files Created (4)

- `docs/legal/institutional-principles.md` — the six canonical principles
  (current operating entity, future commercial structure, constitutional
  structure, reserve independence, foundation, constitution first). Uses
  the user's exact wording.
- `docs/roadmap/organizational-roadmap.md` — three-stage roadmap (Stage 1
  Current LIVE: Founder → JOZOUR LLC; Stage 2 Planned: Founder → Holding →
  [Operations | Markets]; Stage 3 TARGET: commercial side + constitutional
  side, clearly labelled, never implying these entities already exist).
- `docs/verification/institutional-contradiction-report.md` — enumerates
  all 14 contradictions found and how each was remediated.
- `docs/verification/final-certification.md` — certification of alignment
  with the six principles, lint result, and independence-rule verification
  matrix.

### Files Modified (9)

- `src/lib/commercial-governance.ts` — added `EntityStatus` type,
  `status: EntityStatus` field on `ConstitutionalEntity`, `status:
  "planned"` on all four entities, plus a canonical comment block: "These
  entities are PLANNED. The current operating entity is JOZOUR LLC (NJ)."
- `src/components/institutional-economics.tsx` — added TARGET-architecture
  notice box at top, added `planned?: boolean` prop to `FlowNode`, set
  `planned` on all four entity FlowNodes (Foundation, Holding, Operations,
  Markets), added PLANNED badges on entity cards in §5, replaced the
  reserve-integrity paragraph with the canonical Principle 4 wording.
- `src/components/commercial-governance-dashboard.tsx` — added TARGET-
  architecture notice box at top, added inline PLANNED badge to every
  entity card title in `EntitiesTab`, added canonical-rule comment block.
- `src/lib/site-data.ts` — added `canonicalDisclaimer` and
  `reserveIndependence` fields to `LEGAL_STATUS` (verbatim canonical
  wording), added INSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES comment block above the
  constant.
- `README.md` — added a new "Institutional Structure" section with five
  subsections: Current Operator (LIVE), Future Commercial Structure
  (planned), Future Constitutional Structure (planned), Reserve
  Independence (canonical wording), Canonical Disclaimer.
- `src/app/legal/terms/page.tsx` — added the exact canonical disclaimer
  paragraph as an amber notice below the page header.
- `src/app/legal/privacy/page.tsx` — added the exact canonical disclaimer
  paragraph as an amber notice below the page header.
- `src/app/legal/risk-disclosure/page.tsx` — added the exact canonical
  disclaimer paragraph as an amber notice below the page header.
- `docs/whitepaper.md` — added "Institutional Status Disclaimer" section
  with the canonical disclaimer, reserve-independence wording, and the
  planned commercial + constitutional diagrams; labelled the Foundation in
  front matter as "(planned)"; expanded the Section 9 note to explicitly
  state all four future entities are planned and JOZOUR LLC is NOT the
  Institution / reserve owner / reserve custodian / constitutional
  authority; updated Contact section.

### Lint Result

```bash
$ bun run lint
$ eslint .
===EXIT CODE: 0===
```

**PASS.** Zero ESLint warnings, zero ESLint errors. No new TypeScript errors
introduced by Task 18. Pre-existing TypeScript errors in unrelated files
(`next.config.ts`, `src/app/demo/page.tsx`, `src/lib/db.ts`,
`src/lib/tests/financial-soundness-tests.ts`,
`src/lib/tests/game-theory-audit.ts`) are explicitly out of scope and
documented in `docs/verification/final-certification.md`.
